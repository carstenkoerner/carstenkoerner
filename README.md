- Hi, I’m @carstenkoerner
- I’m currently reorienting myself and working/learning on becoming a software developer (full stack).
- I’m currently learning C#, WPF, Blazor, SQL, Git/GitHub...
- I’m looking to collaborate on some open source projects to learn to better read and understand existing code
- You can reach me by mail (mail@ckoerner.dev) or via Discord (mrgru74_19945).
